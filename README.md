## Environment Configuration

- Sanctum token-based auth is used for API protection.

- Telescope UI is available at: http://localhost:8000/telescope

- API base URL: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/

---

## Task Breakdown

**Task 1: Eloquent Relationships & Aggregation**

- Models: Organization, Team, Employee
- Relationships:
    - Organization hasMany Teams
    - Team belongsTo Organization
    - Team hasMany Employees
- Report:
    - Average salary per team
    - Total employees per organization
- Optimized with Eager Loading
- Used Eloquent scope

-----

**Task 2: API with Sanctum & RBAC**

- Sanctum installed for token-based auth
- API routes grouped by version: /api/v1/*
- CRUD for Organizations, Teams, Employees
- Roles: user (default) for now
- Used middleware for RBAC
- Example endpoints:
    - GET /api/v1/employees
    - GET /api/v1/organizations
    - GET /api/v1/teams

-----

**Task 3: Event-Driven Processing**

- JSON Import handled Event
- Laravel Queues used for background job
- SalaryUpdated event logs salary change
- Notification for progress tracking and error handling

-----


**Task 4: PDF Report Package**

- Custom package: aci/employee-reports
- Path-based repository: packages/Aci/EmployeeReports
- Endpoint to generate report
```bash
http://localhost:8000/employee-report/download
```
- Uses barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
- Command:
```bash
composer require aci/employee-reports:dev-main
```

-----

**Task 5: DB Optimization & Telescope**

- Indexes added on employees.start_date and employees.team_id
- Telescope installed and accessible at /telescope
- Used to inspect:
    - Slow queries
    - Query performance
    - Exceptions and logs

---

## Testing
- Feature and unit tests in tests/Feature and tests/Unit
- Run all tests:
```bash
php artisan test

```
---

## Performance Report
- Avg Query Time Before Indexing: 120ms
- Avg Query Time After Indexing: 25ms
- N+1 Queries Resolved: Yes (added `with('team.organization')`)
- Telescope Observations:
    - Query: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE start_date >= ?`
        - Time: 22ms
        - Optimized via index on `start_date`

Conclusion: Adding indexes and eager-loading reduced total load time by ~80%.
